## Project Title: Excuse-Me-Please
## Project Overview:
- * Wish you had that sort of 'Magic' button where you press and the perfect excuse would always come up? "Excuse-Me-Please" is basically an excuse generator. This web app is meant to give relief during a time of very tight conditions in a humorous manner. So whether you are running late for a meeting, need to leave a social event, or just want a good laugh, the Excuse Generator is what you need.

## Key Features:

- * Spontaneous Excuses: This magic button will offer you some instant excuses on the spot funny.
- * Excuse for Every Situation: Whether you are in front of the HR or the judge, we all have various different categories and preferences that cover everything.
- * Your Excuses, Hold to Them: Think you're a few hits away from writing some good lines? Come share them! Allow the community enjoy your humor.
- * Designed just for You (Maybe!): We actually have been designing a future addition even more customizable.
- * Share the Laughs: Have a blast of the best excuses with your buddies and let the fun go viral!
Tech Stack:

- * I shall make use of the most attractive technologies possible to push everything through:

- * That 'Frontend Magic': HTML, CSS, JSâ€“ the building blocks of a laudable website. Not to mention, a generous dollop of React.js: makes it super interactive and therefore loads of fun to use. CSS framework will shine out as sleek as a fine presentation of the website.

- * That 'Backend Powerhouse': Node.js is the beast's engine, and Express.js is the one driving it. Typically, MongoDB is used to store excuses as well as personal user information.

## Why this project:
- * Leveling Up Skills: I'm eager to learn and grow as a web developer, and this project is a fantastic opportunity to put my skills to the test. Unleashing Creativity: Coming up with funny and believable excuses requires a bit of imagination, and it's exciting to see what I can come up with. Building Something Fun and silly: I want to create an app that people actually enjoy using. Something that makes them smile and maybe even helps them out of a jam (or two!)
